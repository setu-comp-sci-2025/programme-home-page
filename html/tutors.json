","contentMd":"# Higher Diploma in Computer Science 2025\n \n The ONLINE Higher Diploma in Science in Computer Science is a 24-month ICT Conversion Course designed to allow honours graduates from non-computing disciplines to acquire the industry-relevant ICT and software development skills, expertise and practical experience required to become suitable candidates for employment in the ICT domain in general and in software development in particular. \n\n Successful applicants for this course will be existing honours graduates (level 8) with the capacity and aptitude (for example numeracy skills) to complete an intensive Computer Science programme and work placement. Typical disciplines which would fall into this category would be Engineering; Architecture; Mathematics, Physics and Financial Services. These students are generally strongly suited to the programme.\n\nWe have also successfully graduated students with a good general analytic aptitude, with an academic background in Management Information Systems, Economics; Accounting; Business and the Arts. For these students, we request that they sample a taster of the programme consisting of the first 4 weeks of the semester 1 content to ascertain their level of interest and disposition towards the discipline (available here: https://wit-hdip-comp-sci.github.io/). This has provided a more comprehensive screening method, with students self-selecting into the programme if they are comfortable with this experience.","frontMatter":{},"id":"programme-home-page","img":"https://{{COURSEURL}}/course.png","imgFile":"course.png","video":"","videoids":{"videoid":"","videoIds":[]},"hide":false,"los":[{"route":"/topic/{{COURSEURL}}/","type":"unit","title":"Semester One - January - June 2025","summary":"Semester One - January - June 2025","contentMd":"Semester One - January - June 2025","frontMatter":{},"id":"unit-1","img":"","imgFile":"","video":"","videoids":{"videoid":"","videoIds":[]},"hide":false,"los":[{"route":"/course/setu-hdip-comp-sci-2025-faq","type":"web","title":" FAQ","summary":"Questions and Answers for new students on the programme","contentMd":"# FAQ\n\nQuestions and Answers for new students on the programme","frontMatter":{"icon":{"type":"flat-color-icons:faq"}},"id":"web---faq","img":"","imgFile":"","video":"","videoids":{"videoid":"","videoIds":[]},"hide":false},{"route":"/course/setu-hdip-comp-sci-2025-workshop-1-3","type":"web","title":" Workshop One","summary":"induction · structure · schedules · handbook","contentMd":"# Workshop One\n\n\ninduction · structure · schedules · handbook","frontMatter":{"icon":{"type":"ri:bubble-chart-fill","color":"009656"}},"id":"web-0-workshop-1","img":"","imgFile":"","video":"","videoids":{"videoid":"","videoIds":[]},"hide":false},{"route":"/course/life-etc-2023","type":"web","title":"Life etc...","summary":"time · space · balance  · experiences  · tips · techniques","contentMd":"Life etc...\n\ntime · space · balance  · experiences  · tips · techniques","frontMatter":{"icon":{"type":"ri:plant-fill","color":"9d578a"}},"id":"web-1-life-etc","img":"","imgFile":"","video":"","videoids":{"videoid":"","videoIds":[]},"hide":false},{"route":"/course/setu-hdip-comp-sci-2025-web-dev-1","type":"web","title":"Web Development I","summary":"html · css · layout · web apps · web frameworks · templating","contentMd":"Web Development I\n\nhtml · css · layout · web apps · web frameworks · templating","frontMatter":{"icon":{"type":"ri:file-code-fill","color":603980}},"id":"web-2-web-dev-1","img":"","imgFile":"","video":"","videoids":{"videoid":"","videoIds":[]},"hide":false},{"route":"/course/setu-hdip-comp-sci-2025-programming","type":"web","title":"Programming","summary":"algorithms · data structures · processing · java · classes · libraries","contentMd":"Programming\n\nalgorithms · data structures · processing · java · classes · libraries","frontMatter":{"icon":{"type":"ri:settings-4-fill","color":"f4a13b"}},"id":"web-3-programming","img":"","imgFile":"","video":"","videoids":{"videoid":"","videoIds":[]},"hide":false}]}],"properties":{"credits":"Department of Computing & Mathematics, SETU","portfolio":true,"slack":"https://setu-hdip-comp-sci-25.slack.com","ignorepin":2125},"calendar":{"title":"Semester 1","weeks":[{"Mon Dec 23 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)":{"title":-3,"type":"Introductions"}},{"Mon Dec 30 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)":{"title":-2,"type":"Registration"}},{"Mon Jan 06 2025 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)":{"title":-1,"type":"Induction"}},{"Mon Jan 13 2025 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)":{"title":0,"type":"Induction"}},{"Mon Jan 20 2025 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)":{"title":1,"type":"Tuition"}},{"Mon Jan 27 2025 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)":{"title":2,"type":"Tuition"}},{"Mon Feb 03 2025 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)":{"title":3,"type":"Tuition"}},{"Mon Feb 10 2025 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)":{"title":4,"type":"Tuition"}},{"Mon Feb 17 2025 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)":{"title":"Reading 1","type":"Reading"}},{"Mon Feb 24 2025 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)":{"title":5,"type":"Tuition"}},{"Mon Mar 03 2025 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)":{"title":6,"type":"Tuition"}},{"Mon Mar 10 2025 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)":{"title":7,"type":"Tuition"}},{"Mon Mar 17 2025 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)":{"title":"Reading 2","type":"Reading"}},{"Mon Mar 24 2025 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)":{"title":8,"type":"Tuition"}},{"Mon Mar 31 2025 01:00:00 GMT+0100 (Irish Standard Time)":{"title":9,"type":"Tuition"}},{"Mon Apr 07 2025 01:00:00 GMT+0100 (Irish Standard Time)":{"title":10,"type":"Tuition"}},{"Mon Apr 14 2025 01:00:00 GMT+0100 (Irish Standard Time)":{"title":"Easter 1","type":"Reading"}},{"Mon Apr 21 2025 01:00:00 GMT+0100 (Irish Standard Time)":{"title":"Easter 2","type":"Reading"}},{"Mon Apr 28 2025 01:00:00 GMT+0100 (Irish Standard Time)":{"title":11,"type":"Tuition"}},{"Mon May 05 2025 01:00:00 GMT+0100 (Irish Standard Time)":{"title":12,"type":"Tuition"}},{"Mon May 12 2025 01:00:00 GMT+0100 (Irish Standard Time)":{"title":"Reading 5","type":"Reading"}},{"Mon May 19 2025 01:00:00 GMT+0100 (Irish Standard Time)":{"title":"Reading 6","type":"Reading"}}]}}
